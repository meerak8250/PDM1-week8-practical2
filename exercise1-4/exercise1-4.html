    <h1>Exercise 1.4</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p><code>sketch.js</code> contains almost complete code for a scene generator. It allows the user 
            to place sprites on a drawing areas to design a pixel-art scene that can be used in the solution to 
            the previous exercise. Run the code and try creating a scene.</p>
            <p>The only thing missing is the save functionality, which should allow the user to download their 
                creation as a text file. Complete the <code>saveLevel()</code> function to add this functionality. The 
                images and their locations are stored in the <code>placedSprites</code> global array (as <code>Sprite</code> objects). 
                The information in the file should have exactly the same format as the text files you worked with in the 
                previous exercise.
            </p>
            <p><strong><em>Read the existing code before starting to write your own!</em> You should only add / edit code inside 
            the <code>saveLevel()</code> function.</strong></p>
            <p>You should be able to use the downloaded text file in your solution to exercise 1-3. To do this, move the downloaded file into 
                the assets folder and edit the name of the file loaded into the sketch with <code>loadStrings()</code>. </p>
            <p>This exercise doesn't have a check file because the output of the <code>saveLevel()</code> function can't be 
            automatically tested.</p>
            <p>Expected output - Generator:</p>

            <p>Here is the scene created by the file downloaded in the above video:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="assets/exercise1-4.png" alt="The scene created by scene.txt downloaded from the generator" width="300px" height="300px">
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <button class="btn btn-primary hint" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#hint" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="hint">
                Hint
            </button>
            <div class="collapse" id="hint">
                <div class="card card-body">
                    <p>You only need to add code inside the <code>saveLevel()</code> function.</p>
                    <p>You will need a <code>for</code> loop to iterate through each item in the <code>placedSprites</code> 
                    global array, which contains all <code>Sprite</code> object placed on the drawing area. The <code>Sprite</code> class, 
                defined at the bottom of sketch.js, is exactly the same as the <code>Sprite</code> class in the previous exercise.</p>
                    <p>Inside the for loop, you will need to use the information contained in the <code>Sprite</code> object to build a 
                        line of text that will be saved for the file. The hardest part is to get the name of the <code>Sprite</code>. You 
                    will need a conditional and the <code>Sprite</code> method, <code>getImage()</code>. Use the conditional to figure out 
                    which of the global image variables the sprite is equal to e.g.</p>
                    <pre>sprite.getImage() === grass</pre>
                    <p>...the above boolean expression checks if the image in the <code>Sprite</code> is the same as the image store 
                    in the <code>grass</code> variable.</p>
                    <p>You will also need to use the <code>Sprite</code> methods <code>getX()</code> and <code>getY()</code>. To convert 
                    these three pieces of information into a comma separated string, use a string concatenation method. We covered string 
                    concatenation in week 6 lecture 1.</p>
